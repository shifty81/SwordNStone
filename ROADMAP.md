2. ✅ Frustum culling (objects outside camera view ignored)
3. ✅ Texture atlasing for blocks
4. ✅ VBO/VAO for efficient mesh rendering
5. ✅ Delta time for frame-independent animation

### Recommended Future Optimizations

#### Rendering
1. **Greedy Meshing**

2. **Occlusion Culling**
   - Don't render chunks completely hidden by others
   - Use bounding box tests
   - Priority: High

3. **Level of Detail (LOD)**
   - Distant chunks use simplified meshes
   - Reduce detail beyond certain distance
   - Priority: Medium

4. **Instanced Rendering**
   - For repeated models (trees, grass, items)
   - Single draw call for many objects
   - Priority: Medium

#### Networking
1. **Chunk Compression**
   - Compress chunk data before sending
   - Use run-length encoding for sparse data
   - Priority: High

2. **Delta Updates**
   - Only send changed blocks, not entire chunks
   - Track dirty chunks
   - Priority: High

3. **Entity Interpolation**
   - Smooth player movement between updates
   - Reduce network update frequency
   - Priority: Medium

4. **Interest Management**
   - Only send updates for nearby entities/chunks
   - Reduce bandwidth per player
   - Priority: High

#### Memory
1. **Texture Streaming**
   - Load high-res textures on demand
   - Keep low-res in memory
   - Priority: Low (mobile priority: High)

2. **Chunk Pooling**
   - Reuse chunk objects instead of GC
   - Reduces memory allocation overhead
   - Priority: Medium

3. **Asset Bundling**
   - Bundle related assets together
   - Reduce file I/O operations
   - Priority: Low

#### Gameplay
1. **AI Optimization**
   - Limit pathfinding updates
   - Use spatial partitioning for entity queries
   - Sleep distant entities
   - Priority: High (when mobs added)

2. **Physics Optimization**
   - Spatial hashing for collision detection
   - Sleep static entities
   - Reduce physics update frequency for distant entities

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Known Issues
1. **Linux/Mono Networking**
   - ENet native library compatibility issues
   - Workaround: Use Windows for server hosting
   - Priority: Medium

2. **GUI Scaling**
   - Some UI elements may not scale perfectly on all resolutions
   - Mostly affects ultra-wide monitors
   - Priority: Low

3. **Build Warnings**
   - ~107 compiler warnings (unused variables, obsolete APIs)
   - Don't affect functionality
   - Priority: Low (cleanup)

### Limitations
1. **World Height:** Fixed at 128 blocks (expandable with code changes)
2. **World Size:** 9984×9984 default (customizable but limited by memory)
3. **Max Players:** Server-dependent (typically 50-100)
4. **Mobile:** Not currently supported (major undertaking)
